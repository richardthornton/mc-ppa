# Pig Protection Agency datapack for Minecraft
A running joke on my [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/richardthornton) is that I shouldn't kill and eat the pigs when I'm playing Minecraft. A viewer has even made some donations in the name of the "Pig Protection Agency". During one stream I joked I should make a datapack that protects all pigs in the game, et voil√†!

This datapack can be downloaded to your Minecraft world folder and serves one single purpose: pigs cannot be killed. It makes no further changes to the game.
